Processing of OD600 Growth Data to Calculate Maximum OD and Maximum Growth Rate Using Valid Samples Only

This repository contains a Python script designed for a data paper to process bacterial growth curve data collected in two media conditions: M63 and LB. 
The script loads OD600 time-series data from an Excel file, performs quality control, calculates key growth parameters, conducts statistical comparisons, and automatically generates publication-quality plots.
